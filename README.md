# little-taco-shop
A simple and responsive restaurant website built using core HTML5 concepts such as semantic elements, tables, forms, media tags, and navigation structure. This project demonstrates the practical use of &lt;header>, &lt;main>, &lt;article>, &lt;section>, &lt;figure>, &lt;time>, &lt;abbr>, and &lt;details> for building a modern web layout.
